## The Stat Workshop

+ Workshop [hours and location](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/43539). 
    + BM office hours are Wed 11:00-noon in the Workshop.

## Getting Started with RStudio

+ In Stat305/605, 
    + software demos will be in **RStudio**  
        + RStudio allows you to better organize your work in R.
    + exercise templates will be in **R Markdown** 
        + R Markdown documents allow you to integrate your written comments with R commands and their output. 

## What is RStudio? 

+ RStudio is a free "integrated development environment" (IDE) for R. 
+ Basically it is an interface that makes it easier to work with R and get organized on your computer.

## What is R Markdown? 

+ R Markdown is a file format for making documents with R. 

+ An R Markdown document is written in markdown, a simple plain text format, and allows you to integrate chunks of embedded R commands as well as their output. 

+ R Markdown allows you to author documents in file formats such as PDF,  Word and HTML.  

+ The R-Markdown document interface is available in RStudio. (For Jupyter users, an R Markdown document is like a Jupyter Notebook.)
